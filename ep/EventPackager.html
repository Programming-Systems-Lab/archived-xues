    <h2>Warning - prerelease version!</h2>
    <p>This release of the Event Packager is a prerelease leading up to version 
    2.0.&nbsp; While the functionality is (mostly) complete, testing and 
    documentation is <i>not</i>.&nbsp; If you have bug reports, feel free to 
    report them to the author (see the bottom of the page), but note that this 
    version is not officially supported.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The Event Packager (EP) component of XUES provides a first-level processing 
    infrastructure for the KX system.  It is responsible for preprocessing 
    incoming events, applying filters, transforms, and supporting spooling 
    applications.&nbsp; Event Packager is concerned with <i>per-event </i>
    manipulation; <i>cross-event </i>manipulation is the responsibility of the 
    Event Distiller module.<h2>System requirements</h2>
    <p>Java 1.4.0 is strongly recommended; this is the official supported 
    platform for this prerelase.&nbsp; While 1.3.X should work, it is no longer 
    actively supported.&nbsp; The 1.4.1 release candidates should work, but they 
    have not been fully tested either.&nbsp; Versions prior to v1.3.0 will <i>
    not</i> work; in particular, the use of ShutdownHooks in the code prevent EP 
    from functioning in these environments.</p>
    <p>EP depends on a number of third-party packages.&nbsp; For your 
    convenience, these are bundled in the release distribution as <b>
    xues-support.jar</b>.&nbsp; 
    Make sure to include it, along with the <b>EventDistiller.jar</b>, in your 
    CLASSPATH prior to executing EP.&nbsp; This jar includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/documentation.html">
      Apache Log4j 1.2.4</a>.&nbsp; Log4j versions 1.2.x are supported.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~carzanig/siena/index.html">Siena 
      1.4.2</a>.&nbsp; 
      EP is compatible with 1.3 and 1.4 versions, although 1.4.2 is recommended 
      as it has a number of bugfixes and performance improvements.</li>
      <li><a href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net">Hypersonic SQL DB 1.61</a>.&nbsp; This is a free open-source database that 
      supports the minimum subset of SQL/JDBC functionality needed for EP.&nbsp; 
      It is not required, although is useful if you are planning to use the JDBC 
      spooling functionality in Event Packager.</li>
      <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/crimson/index.html">Apache Crimson</a>.&nbsp; This is only present for backwards functionality 
      with Java 1.3 environments; Java 1.4 ignores the classes in this bundle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of the nonrequired components (e.g., Crimson, Siena 1.4, or HSQLDB 
    1.61) are incompatible with your environment, feel free to substitute 
    components with alternatives indicated above.</p>
    <h2>Execution</h2>
    <p>
      EP may be executed in one of two ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Standalone:</b> in this mode, EP runs in its own JVM, and uses 
      external communication mechanisms (e.g., Siena, Sockets, etc.)<br>
      <br>
      To execute EP in this fashion, issue the following command:<br>
      <br>
      <b>java psl.xues.ep.EventPackager [-c configFile] [-d|-df 
      debugScript] [-?]<br>
      <br>
      </b>As is implied, -? instructs EP to print a usage statement similar to 
      the one above.<b><br>
&nbsp;</b></li>
      <li><b>Embedded:</b> EP can be run in another JVM by being instantiated by 
      a third-party launcher.&nbsp; In this mode, EP can either communicate via 
      external communication mechanisms or via direct method calls.&nbsp; Note that:<ul>
        <li>EP will <i>automatically</i> construct a new thread for itself to 
        run in;</li>
        <li><i>Embedded environments will not be fully supported until v2.0.</i>&nbsp; 
        Specifically, while the containing object may inject events <i>into</i> 
        EP, the callback mechanism to allow the containing object to receive 
        responses directly back <i>from </i>EP is not yet implemented.</li>
        <li>A configuration file is currently <i>required</i> for Event Packager 
        startup.&nbsp; v2.0 will fully support dynamic rule declaration, at 
        which point it will be possible to request EP to start with an empty 
        rulebase.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To use EP in an embedded fashion, use one of the following 
      constructors.<ul>
        <li>For basic configuration (i.e., just a config file specification), 
        use<br>
        <b>public EventPackager(String configFile);</b></li>
        <li>For full configuration options, use<br>
        <b>public EventPackager(String configFile, boolean debugging, String 
        debugFile);</b></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Both mechanisms have a number of options.</p>

      </tr>
      </table>
    <p>
      Once the Event Packager is run, it will run in the background.
      No further user interaction is required, although if the console is 
      enabled in the configuration file it will now appear and will be ready for 
      manual control of the Event Pacakger.&nbsp; See the sections &quot;Operation&quot; 
      and &quot;Configuration Files&quot;, below, to control EP's behavior hereon.</p>
    <h2>Operation</h2>
    <h3>
      All modes</h3>
    <p>
      When the Event Packager starts, it will immediately start parsing its 
      configuration file and following the directives contained within.&nbsp; If 
      there are errors in this file they will appear on the console (or other 
      debugging output, if the <b>debugFile</b> option was used during 
      initialization).</p>
    <p>
      If at this point a ConsoleInput has been specified, you will be presented 
      with the console prompt.&nbsp; Type &quot;help&quot; at the prompt to get an 
      overview of the available options at that point.</p>
    <p>
      The Event Packager has several top-level constructs that do most of the 
      work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <b>Event Type</b>, which is defined as a subclass of a top-level 
      event type, that provides storage and conversion facilities for the 
      associated data;</li>
      <li>One or more <b>Plugins</b>, all defined as subclasses of a top-level 
      plugin type:<ul>
        <li>An <b>Input</b>, whose responsibility it is to listen to events and 
        to introduce (&quot;inject&quot;) them into the EP;</li>
        <li>An <b>Output</b>, whose responsibility it is to take events and 
        publish them (or dispatch them) somewhere;</li>
        <li>A <b>Transform</b>, whose responsibility it is to take an EPEvent 
        and transform it into another EPEvent (possibly of the same type, or 
        possibly of another type);</li>
        <li>A <b>Store</b>, whose responsibility it is to support (preferably) 
        persistent event storage for Inputs, Transforms, and Outputs;</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>And a <b>Rule</b>, which binds one or more Inputs, Outputs, and 
      Transforms together to create a simple event workflow given a situation.&nbsp; 
      (Stores and Event Types are implicitly used within Inputs, Outputs, and 
      Transforms).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      EP comes bundled with a large variety of Types, Inputs, Outputs, 
      Transforms, and Stores to enable you to quickly assemble microworkflows to 
      process and convert events of various types.</p>
    <p>
      In a nutshell, the basic processing engine for EP is very simple: <i>For 
      any event injected into the Event Packager by a running Input, for all 
      rules that this Input has been associated with, process the Transforms (if 
      any) declared in the rule on the Event, one-by-one and in order (taking 
      the result out of one Transform and handing it to the next), and output 
      the resulting event to all Outputs associated with the Rule (not 
      guaranteed to be in-order).</i></p>
    <p>
      Notes on the above definition:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do <i>not</i> confuse the notion of an Plugin type (e.g., a type of 
      Input) with an Plugin instance.&nbsp; Rules are bound to Plugin instances; 
      these may include several instantiations of the same Type.&nbsp; For 
      example, EP is (theoretically) capable of subscribing to an infinite 
      number of Siena buses (via &quot;SienaInput&quot;), each with a different associated 
      Rule (or Rules).&nbsp; Avoid using the same name for an Plugin type name 
      and a Plugin instance name.</li>
      <li>Note that, for each rule, an Input and an Output instance must exist.&nbsp; 
      Use the special NullOutput Output type if you don't want to keep the 
      Output data.</li>
      <li>Multiple Inputs on a rule means that rule matches any one of the 
      Inputs.&nbsp; Multiple Transforms implies they are process in-order for 
      each event injected per that rule, and Multiple Outputs implies that the 
      resultant event is broadcasted to <i>all</i> of the declared outputs in 
      that Rule.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Special notes for embedded operation</h3>
    <p>
      EP will accept notifications handed to it directly: use the 
      injectEvent() method and hand it an instance of EPEvent.&nbsp; Note that 
      the &quot;source&quot; in the EPEvent is critical to determine what rules will be 
      processed for this event.&nbsp; If the source does not bind to any rules, 
      the event will not be processed at all.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> It is
      strongly suggested that the <tt>shutdown()</tt> method be called during 
    shutdown of the owner. ED runs in a separate thread, and this ensures that 
    the thread will be killed in a safe fashion.</p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
      The heart of Event Packager's Event, Plugin and Rule declarations lies in the 
      configuration. It is in XML, and has several sections.&nbsp; These 
      sections are all embedded in a top-level <b>
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;EventPackagerConfiguration&gt;</font></b> 
      tag.&nbsp; Any fixed-type font implies a configuration directive.&nbsp; 
      Italics indicate something undefined here (i.e., fill it in with the 
      appropriate value as you see fit).&nbsp; &quot;FullyQualifiedClassName&quot; implies 
      the package + class name, e.g., &quot;psl.xues.ep.output.NullOutput&quot;.</p>
    <p>
      EP configuration files essentially specify custom Event Types and Plugins.&nbsp; 
      While the EP itself requires certain basic attributes, many custom 
      attributes or subelements are required by the constituient Plugins.&nbsp; 
      Please see the respective EP <a href="javadoc/">Javadoc</a> for the plugin 
      to see what these required attributes/elements are; they are generally 
      well-documented (and are improving as the 2.0 release approaches).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;EventFormats&gt;</font></b> 
      declares the Event Types section, which consists of one or more 
      EventFormat entries.<ul>
        <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;EventFormat Name=&quot;psl.xues.ep.event.<i>EventName</i>&quot; 
        /&gt;</font></b> declares an individual Event format.&nbsp; Note that for 
        EP v2.0, this is <i>not</i> required: EP, via reflection, supports 
        late-binding event types.&nbsp; However, this is useful to ensure you do 
        have the event formats ahead of time, and also allows future event types 
        to have custom parameters.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Inputters&gt;</font></b> declares 
      the Inputs section, which consists of one or more Inputter entries.<ul>
        <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Inputter Name=&quot;<i>InputterInstanceName</i>&quot; 
        Type=&quot;<i>InputterFullyQualifiedClassName</i>&quot; <i>attributes... </i>/&gt;</font></b> 
        declares a single inputter.&nbsp; Name and Type are required at 
        EP-level; other attributes vary depending on the kind of inputter 
        specified.&nbsp; Note that certain Inputters may also have elements 
        embedded in the Inputter declaration.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Outputters&gt;</font></b> declares 
      the Outputs section, which consists of one or more Outputter entries.<ul>
        <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Outputter Name=&quot;<i>OutputterInstanceName</i>&quot; 
        Type=&quot;<i>OutputterFullyQualifiedClassName</i>&quot; <i>attributes... </i>/&gt;</font></b> 
        declares a single outputter.&nbsp; Name and Type are required at 
        EP-level; other attributes vary depending on the kind of outputter 
        specified.&nbsp; Note that certain Outputters may also have elements 
        embedded in the Outputter declaration.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Transforms&gt;</font></b> declares 
      the Transforms section, which consists of one or more Transform entries.<ul>
        <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Transform Name=&quot;<i>TransformInstanceName</i>&quot; 
        Type=&quot;<i>TransformFullyQualifiedClassName</i>&quot; <i>attributes... </i>/&gt;</font></b> 
        declares a single transform.&nbsp; Name and Type are required at 
        EP-level; other attributes vary depending on the kind of transform 
        specified.&nbsp; Note that certain Transforms may also have elements 
        embedded in the Transform declaration.&nbsp; <i>Transforms are optional.</i></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Stores&gt;</font></b> declares 
      the Stores section, which consists of one or more Store entries.<ul>
        <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Store Name=&quot;<i>StoreInstanceName</i>&quot; 
        Type=&quot;<i>StoreFullyQualifiedClassName</i>&quot; <i>attributes... </i>/&gt;</font></b> 
        declares a single store.&nbsp; Name and Type are required at 
        EP-level; other attributes vary depending on the kind of store specified.&nbsp; Note that certain 
        Stores may also have elements 
        embedded in the Store declaration.&nbsp; <i>Stores are optional.</i></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Rules&gt;</font></b> is the last 
      section, and binds all of the above instances together.<ul>
        <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Rule Name=&quot;<i>RuleName</i>&quot;&gt;</font></b> 
        begins the declaration of rules.<ul>
          <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Inputs&gt;</font></b> begins 
          the binding of inputs to this rule.<ul>
            <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Input Name=&quot;<i>InputterInstanceName</i>&quot;&gt;</font></b> 
            binds the respective input instance to this rule.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Transforms&gt;</font></b> 
          begins the binding of transforms to this rule.&nbsp; <i>Transforms are 
          optional.</i><ul>
            <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Transform Name=&quot;<i>TransformInstanceName</i>&quot;&gt;</font></b> 
            binds the respective transform instance to this rule.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Outputs&gt;</font></b> begins 
          the binding of outputs to this rule.<ul>
            <li><b><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;Output Name=&quot;<i>OutputterInstanceName</i>&quot;&gt;</font></b> 
            binds the respective output instance to this rule.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ... and that's it.&nbsp; Once the rules are correctly bound, you have a 
      complete EP configuration which is capable of processing everything 
      declared above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>NOTES:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The EP interactive console requires a declaration in the above 
      configuration; to be precise, an &quot;EPInput&quot; instance must be created and 
      bound.&nbsp; (The interactive console is not recommended for embedded 
      environments).</li>
      <li>A number of example configuration 
      files are included in &quot;examples/&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dynamic run-time configuration</h2>
    <p>
      EP's dynamic run-time support is not functional yet; this section will be 
      updated as appropriate to reflect new functionality in this area.</p>
    <h2>More to come</h2>
    <p>There are many known issues; this list is not complete, but will be 
    updated in the next official release.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The inconsistency between the notion of &quot;Inputs&quot; and &quot;Inputters&quot; 
      (they are conceptually one and the same) will be resolved in an upcoming 
      release;</li>
      <li>Dynamic Rule and Plugin management is coming in v2.0;</li>
      <li>More comprehensive documentation on how to use EP spooling and 
      playback;</li>
      <li>... and a whole lot more!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples, Source Code, Javadocs</h2>
    <p>
      As previously mentioned, a number of examples are included with the Event 
      Packager distribution. You can unjar the Event Packager jar 
      file to obtain  test code as well as the full Event Distiller source 
      code.</p>
