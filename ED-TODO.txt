Event loopback support.  Apparently already done, needs testing.

Perhaps, to solve the spamblocker rule, a way of limiting the number
of simultaneous threads, or absorb rules.  
* Consider implementing ordering in ED.  Looks like we have to
implement this in DOS as well.

Integrate James's daughter-of-Siena (DOS).  Will be done once DOS has
grown up :)

What if all the attributes for a state are not there?  ED looks at the
specified subset, so this should not be a problem.

Clean up the schema file (Janak).

Dynamic rules - what happens if you try to add a rule that already
exists?  Already fixed (EDStateManager).

"Counter" feature for "identical" events (matching a given filter) -
e.g. an action is generated if X instances of the notification are
encountered.

Take and modify matched notifications into an action.
