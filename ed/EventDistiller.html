    Documentation</h2>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The Event Distiller (ED) is the core of the XUES subsystem within the KX
    infrastructure.  It is responsible for performing event pattern
    recognition and notification in a close to real-time fashion.  It
    has several features that make it uniquely suited for the
    real-time event monitoring aspect that KX requires.
    <h2>System requirements</h2>
    <p>Java 1.3.X (i.e., any 1.3-based version).&nbsp; 1.2 is not supported due 
    to the use of ShutdownHooks in the code (although it may work if these are 
    removed).&nbsp; 1.4 <i>should</i> work, but has not yet been fully tested.</p>
    <p>ED depends on a number of third-party packages.&nbsp; For your 
    convenience, these are bundled in the release distribution as <b>psl-all.jar</b>.&nbsp; 
    Make sure to include it, along with the <b>EventDistiller.jar</b>, in your 
    CLASSPATH prior to executing ED or constructing a new one inside another 
    program.&nbsp; These 
    packages include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/documentation.html">
      Apache Log4j 1.1.3</a>.&nbsp; New versions may work but are not tested.</li>
      <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html">Apache Xerces-J 
      1.x</a>.&nbsp; v2.0 might work, but is untested.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~carzanig/siena/index.html">Siena</a>.&nbsp; 
      1.1.2, 1.2.0, and 1.3.0 have been tested.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Execution</h2>
    <p>
      Please see the XUES general documentation for common requirements
      and associated install instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      ED may be executed in one of two ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Standalone:</b> in this mode, ED runs in its own JVM, and uses 
      Siena as its communication mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      To execute ED in this fashion, issue the following command:<br>
      <br>
      <b>java psl.xues.ed.EventDistiller &lt;-s sienaHost&gt; [-f ruleSpecFile] [-d|-df 
      debugScript] [-o outputFileName] [-event] [-?]<br>
&nbsp;</b></li>
      <li><b>Embedded:</b> ED can be run in another JVM by being instantiated by 
      a third-party launcher.&nbsp; In this mode, ED can either communicate via 
      Siena or via direct method calls.&nbsp; Note that ED will <i>automatically</i> 
      construct a new thread for itself to run in.<ul>
        <li>For Siena-based communication, use the following constructor:<br>
        <b>public EventDistiller(String sienaHost, String specFile, boolean 
        eventDriven, String outputFile, boolean debugging, String debugFile);</b></li>
        <li>For direct communication, use the following constructor(s).&nbsp; 
        You must supply an implementation of siena.Notifiable to get the 
        callbacks when a pattern is matched (or if it fails).<br>
        <b>public EventDistiller(Notifiable owner, String spec, boolean 
        eventDriven, String outputFile, boolean debugging, String debugFile);</b><br>
        <b>public EventDistiller(Notifiable owner);</b> <i>(note that this one 
        assumes defaults for the aforementioned options)</i> </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Both mechanisms have a number of options.</p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Once the Event Distiller is run, it will run in the background.
      No further user interaction is required - all manipulations are
      done over the Siena bus (or through local notifications) from this point on.  See the sections
      "Operation" and "Configuration Files", below.</p>
    <h2>Operation</h2>
    <h3>
      Standalone and embedded Siena modes</h3>
    <p>
      Once the Event Distiller is running, it will immediately begin
      subscribing to notifications it is interested in (based on the
      rule file supplied at start-time) and listening for instances of
      these notifications.  Upon a rule match (or a partial match),
      appropriate notifications will be sent out on the same Siena
      bus based on the rules defined in the specification file.</p>
    <p>
      There are two special attributes that ED pays special attention to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>&quot;Type&quot;: </b>In order to prevent ED from listening to <i>everything</i>, 
      the Siena subscription made by ED only listens for events of type &quot;EDInput&quot;.&nbsp; 
      This behavior will be made more flexible in the next ED release.</li>
      <li><b>&quot;Timestamp&quot;:</b> One of the major problems/caveats/compromises with 
      Siena is its inability to guarantee in-order delivery given an ordering 
      upon publication.&nbsp; The ED goes to great lengths to resolve this, <i>
      if</i> a timestamp is stored in the event.&nbsp; If the publisher 
      specifies a timestamp as a long (preferably the number of milliseconds 
      since 1970, i.e., <b>System.currentTimeMillis()</b>), the ED will reorder 
      events to make sure they're in the correct order before processing them.&nbsp; 
      Currently, the ED uses a sliding window (a la TCP) of 1 second (this will 
      be configurable in the next release), during which any events in its queue 
      will be reordered.<font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; (Note that behavior might 
      differ if the event driven property is turned on.)</font></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      All embedded modes</h3>
    <p>
      ED will accept <i>all </i>notifications handed to it directly: use the 
      notify() method and hand it a Siena Notification.&nbsp; As previously 
      mentioned, in direct mode callbacks will be handed to the Notifiable 
      specified in the constructor.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> It is
      strongly suggested that the <tt>shutdown()</tt> method be called during 
    shutdown of the owner. ED runs in a separate thread, and this ensures that 
    the thread will be killed in a safe fashion.</p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
      The heart of Event Distiller configuration lies in the
      rulebase specification file.  It is in XML, based on the schema
      described in the <tt>DistillerRule.xsd</tt> file.
    </p>
    <h3>Distiller rules</h3>
    <ul><li><strong><tt>&lt;rulebase
	    xmlns="http://www.psl.cs.columbia.edu/2001/01/DistillerRule.xsd"&gt;</tt></strong><br>
	This line is the top-level XML rulebase declaration, and is required.
	<hr>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <strong><tt>&lt;rule name="<em>rule
	    name</em>"&gt;</tt></strong><br> This is the top-level
	    rule declarator, is declared within ruleBase, and is
	    repeated at the beginning of each rule. The following parameters
	    may be supplied:
	    <ul>
	    <li> name (required): Rule names are
	    used primarily for disambiguation at this time; they are
	    not referred elsewhere.
	    </li>
	    <li> position (optional):
              the position where this rule is inserted, starting with 0. The position specifies the
	      priority of this rule in receiving events: higher priority rules
	      (smaller numbers) receive events first. This is useful in the case of
	      event absorbtion on the part of a state (see the absorb attribute in state).
	    </li>
            <li>instantiation (optional): the criterion for instantiating this rule.
	      Legal values are: 0, 1, 2. '0' means the rule will only be instantiated once.
	      '1' means there will always be only one instance at any given time, so a new instance is created
	      as the previous succeeds or one times out.
	      '2' means a new instance is created whenever a previous instance starts (i.e.
	      receives its first event), so that there will always be one instance listening for the starting event(s).
	    </li>
	    </ul>
	    <hr>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<strong><tt>&lt;states&gt;</tt></strong><br> This
		declarator, contained in a rule, signifies the
		beginning of state declarations (of which there may be
		many).  <strong>Note:</strong> There can be only one
		"states" declaration in a rule.
		<hr>
		<ul>
		  <li>
		    <strong><tt>&lt;state name="<em>state name</em>"
		    timebound="<em>milliseconds</em>"
		    children="<em>CSV-list of children names</em>"
		    actions="<em>CSV-list of actions</em>"
		    fail_actions="<em>CSV-list of actions</em>"
		    absorb="<em>boolean value</em>"
		    count="<em>integer value</em>"
		    &gt;</tt></strong><br>
		    This is the beginning of declarator for a single
		    state in the state-list (pattern) to be matched
		    for this rule.  A number of parameters are
		    supplied alongside the rule declarator:
		    <ul>
		      <li>
			name (required): specifies the state name.
			This name should not conflict with other
			state names within this rule.
		      </li>
		      <li>
			timebound (required): specifies the timebound
			in which this event can happen relative to the
			previous event. For the first event, the
			timebound is generally set to -1 (e.g. no time
			limit); for subsequent timebounds it is
			<em>recommended</em>, although not required,
			that the timebound be positive. If the first state
			of a rule has positive timebound, it is measured against the
			time at which the rule is created.(Note that
			timebound is not precise - a fudge factor
			is present in the Event Distiller to take care
			of race conditions.)
		      </li>
		      <li>
			children (optional): specifies (in a comma-delimited
			list, no spaces) states that
			can follow this particular state.
		      </li>
		      <li>
			actions (optional): specifies the
			notification(s) to be sent out when this state
			is matched.  Usually, this is intended for the
			last state in a rule, which would signify as
			the "rule matching", but intermediate
			notifications can be sent out.
		      </li>
		      <li>
			fail_actions (optional): specifies the
			notification(s) to be sent out if this state
			times out while waiting for input.  Unlike actions,
			this is intended for each state, so a
			different notification <em>may</em> be sent
			out for a failure at any given point in the
			state machine. Note that if a rule allows multiple paths between states
			(so that at one given time multiple states are subscribed),
			failure notifications for one of the states that timed out will be sent,
			only if all currently subscribed states time out.
		      </li>
		        <li> absorb (optional): Whether this state will absorb the events that match it.
			  If this is set to true, when an event matches this state, the event
			  will <em>not</em> be passes on to any other state cutrrently subscribed.
			  If this field is not specified, a default value of 'false' will be used.
			</li>
			<li> count (optional): the number of times this event will need to be matched
			  before it passes. A default value of '1' is used if this field is not specified.
			  If the value specified is greatr than '1' (say, <em>n</em>, children and actions
			  will only apply to the <em>n</em>th time that the state is matched; while fail_actions,
			  if specified, will apply at all times. The special value '-1' indicates that the event
			  may occur any number of times (within the specified timebound), until one of
			  the children is matched, thus terminating the loop.
			</li>
		    </ul>
		    <hr>
		    <ul>
		      <li>
			<strong><tt>&lt;attribute name="<em>attribute
			name</em>" value="<em>attribute value</em>"
			op="<em>comparison operator</em>" type="<em>
			value type</em>"/&gt;</tt></strong><br> Declarator for an
			attribute-value pair required in this
			particular state.  Note that there may be many
			attributes per state, and they are ANDed
			together in the filter that matches incoming
			notifications to this state.  Since there are
			no embedded tags within this tag, you can use
			the compact end-tag notation (e.g. "/&gt;").
			The comparison operator is a string representation of the 
			operator to be used for matching the value. For instance, 
			you would specify <code>op="&gt"</code> to match all values 
			greater than the one that the specified value.
			The default operator is the equality operator.
			Type needs to be specified since some operators only make sense
			for certain types; the default type is the string type.
			Note that the value field here is matched
			using a string-equals comparison,
			<em>unless</em> a special wildcard-binding
			notation is used (see below).
		      </li>
		    </ul>
		    <hr>
		    <strong><tt>&lt;/state&gt;</tt></strong>
		  </li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<strong><tt>&lt;/states&gt;</tt></strong>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<strong><tt>&lt;actions&gt;</tt></strong><br> This
		declarator, contained in a rule, signifies the
		beginning of <tt>action</tt> declarations (of which
		there may be many).  <strong>Note:</strong> There can
		be only one "actions" declaration in a rule.
		<hr>
		<ul>
		  <li>
		    <strong><tt>&lt;notification
			name="<em>notification
			  name</em>"&gt;</tt></strong><br>
		    This is the beginning of the notification (action)
		    declarator.  There is one parameter, name, which
		    corresponds to the actions and fail_actions
		    references above.  It is <em>strongly</em>
		    recommended that this name be one contiguous
		    phrase without whitespace or punctuation to avoid
		    conflicts in the CSV-lists referenced above.
		    <hr>
		    <ul>
		      <li>
			<strong><tt>&lt;attribute name="<em>attribute
			name</em>" value="<em>attribute value</em>"
			/&gt;</tt></strong><br> Declarator for an
			attribute-value pair to be included in this
			particular notification.  Note that there may
			be many attributes per notification.  Since
			there are no embedded tags within this tag,
			you can use the compact end-tag notation
			(e.g. "/&gt;").  If you use wildcard-binding
			above, you may use the same wildcard-binding
			tag here - it will be substituted with the
			actual bound value (again, see below).
		      </li>
		    </ul>
		    <hr>
		    <strong><tt>&lt;/notification&gt;</tt></strong>
		  </li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<strong><tt>&lt;/actions&gt;</tt></strong>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    <hr>
	    <strong><tt>&lt;/rule&gt;</tt></strong>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<strong><tt>&lt;/rulebase&gt;</tt></strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Wildcard binding</h3>
    <p>
      Attribute values (<em>not</em> names) may be specified as a
      wildcard that is bound on the first match in a particular rule
      instance execution.  This is accomplished by putting a "*" as
      the first character in the matching value, followed by a string
      key (preferably one contiguous phrase, without whitespace).
      When the Event Distiller encounters such a value, it checks the
      key (<em>not</em> the attribute, but rather the string after the
      "*") against its hash of known keys <em>for this rule
      instance</em>, and if not found, it makes a new entry into the
      hash, with the key matching the value that was encountered when
      processing this rule instance.  If the key is matched, i.e. a
      value exists for this key, the state is only validated if the
      incoming value matches the already-stored value for this rule
      instance.  This is useful if you need to match a value
      consistently, or need to match a value once and have the
      resulting value outputted in the notification.  Note that
      separate rule instances keep separate hashes, so another
      execution of this rule being done in parallel does not share the
      wildcard hash.  If you need to match different values for each
      state in a rule or each attribute in a state, use different key
      strings in the "*" notation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a notification (action), if the "*" notation is detected, the
      Event Distiller will attempt to substitute the value matching
      the key in the hash in the output.
      <!-- XXX -->
      If the value doesn't exist,
      the "*" and the key are thrown out and an empty string is
      returned.
      <!-- /XXX -->
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are attempting to match a literal asterisk at the
      beginning of the string, use a double-asterisk as your first two
      characters.  The Event Distiller will throw away the first
      asterisk and will ignore the remainder of the string, e.g.,
      "**foo" will match "*foo" in incoming notifications.
    </p>
    <h2>Dynamic run-time configuration</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the rulebase specification file, rules may be
      added, deleted, or queried for through Siena events.  If the
      "client" (defined here as the party that wishes to change the
      ED's rulebase) is implemented in Java, we have implemented
      methods in a convenience class to automate the task: in
      <tt>psl.kx.KXNotification</tt>, there are methods called
      <tt>EDManagerAddRule</tt>, <tt>EDManagerRemoveRule</tt>,
      <tt>EDManagerQueryRule</tt>, and <tt>EDManagerQueryRules</tt>.
      (C++ users - take a look at the source - the attribute/value
      pairs are extremely simple to copy into a C++ implementation).
    </p>
    <p>Here's a brief description of each method:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>EDManagerAddRule is used to add a rule - specify the XML
	that would normally be in the rulebase specification file,
	e.g., a complete <tt>&lt;rule&gt;</tt> instance.
      </li>
      <li>EDManagerRemoveRule deletes a rule given its name.</li>
      <li>EDManagerQueryRule returns the XML representation of the
	rule that's specified by name.</li>
      <li>EDManagerQueryRules returns a comma-delimited list of all
	the rules in the currently-running rulebase.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These rules are currently saved on exit, if an output filename was specified.
      If an embedded Event Distiller is being used (see below) use the
      <tt>setOutputFile(String fileName)</tt> method to set the output file.
    </p>
    <h2>More to come</h2>
    <p>
      ED is under active development, and we have a number of new features 
      slated for the next release of ED (to be released late Spring 2002), 
      including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Native XML SmartEvent support</li>
      <li>GUI rule designer and administrative tool</li>
      <li>Faster performance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples, Source Code, Javadocs</h2>
    <p>
      A number of examples are included with the Event Distiller
      distribution.  The EDTest*.java files demonstrate typical Event
      Distiller usage (in albeit simple scenarios), while the *.xml
      files are sample rulebases.&nbsp; You can unjar the Event Distiller jar 
      file to obtain this test code as well as the full Event Distiller source 
      code.</p>
    <p>
      Javadoc is available <a href="javadoc/">here</a>.&nbsp; The Javadoc, as 
      well as other information, is also available on the XUES website, located 
      at <a href="http://www.psl.cs.columbia.edu/xues/">
      http://www.psl.cs.columbia.edu/xues/</a>.</p>
